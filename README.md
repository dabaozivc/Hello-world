# Hello-world

Hi everyone,
    My name is Zhang ZhengYang. I'm borned in 1999 12th, at a Chiese town named Xintian in Chongqing. My life is not supposed to exist this world. I live because of my elder sister's disability which is called epilepsy, a awful illness that makes people not be able to move as their mind. 
    When I was a boy, I tried doing things right but minded doing things that are beneficial for me. I played hard and studyed hard. Then I began playing harder but studying less and less. I have lost. Finally, I sucssesed being absent from my colllege named Hunan City University in 2019 4th. After that I got a few different jobs. My girl broke up with me. That made my heart get some kind of hurt that I've never felt, suddenly, I seemed to become nothing. I lay to myself, I am still ok and I could get back in some way. However, after month of struggle, I really realized that I am already a dead man. I stole a phone on my way home by my motor because of an accident that made my phone broken. With some phone calls, ..., I got into prison finally. After the sentence, I am free at my parents, my father's classmate and my identities' help. 
    Keeping playing harder and working less...
    Now, my body will put really on the real mask and the real windbreaker, walking and running with games, music, codes and money, maybe doing things that a man can do, a man can't do, especially a man should do.
    ...
    Good night, good morning and good evening!
